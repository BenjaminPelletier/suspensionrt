# suspensionrt hub

The hub starts an access point (AP) to allow [satellites](../satellite) to connect and transmit UDP packets.  The hub listens for those UDP packets and displays the time-of-flight suspension compression data contained in them on the display.

The hub needs no external hardware; simply upload firmware to a "cheap yellow display" like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D8W9DSYZ).
